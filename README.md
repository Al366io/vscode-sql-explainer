<h1>SQL Explainer</h1>
<p>SQL Explainer is a VS Code extension that uses the OpenAI API to translate SQL queries into English. With this extension, you can quickly understand what a query does and why it's important without having to spend time deciphering SQL code.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use SQL Explainer, you'll need to get an API key from OpenAI. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for a free account at <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup">https://platform.openai.com/signup</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have an API key, you can install SQL Translator by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the extension</li>
  <li>Open a file in VS Code and select the query you want to translate.</li>
  <li>Open the Command Palette by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> (Windows, Linux) or <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code> (macOS).</li>
  <li>Type "SQL Explainer" in the search bar and select the "SQL Explainer: Translate Query" command.</li>
  <li>If prompted, enter your OpenAI API key and press Enter. (will be asked only the first time)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've completed these steps, a window will open on the right side of the screen, showing you the translated query in English. You can also see a shorter explanation (tldr) of the query below the full explanation.</p>
